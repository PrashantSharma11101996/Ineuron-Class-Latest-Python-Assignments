    "Ans4. Lambda functions, also known as anonymous functions, have several advantages and limitations compared to regular functions in Python. Here are some of them:\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantages of Lambda Functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.Concise Syntax: Lambda functions allow you to write functions in a more concise manner compared to regular functions. They are typically defined in a single line and can be used in situations where a full-fledged function would be overkill.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Inline Usage: Lambda functions are often used in scenarios where you need a small function on-the-fly and don't want to define a separate function using the def keyword. They can be directly used as arguments to higher-order functions like map(), filter(), and reduce().\n",
    "\n",
    "3.Improved Readability: In some cases, lambda functions can improve the readability of the code by keeping the logic closer to the point of use. For simple, one-time operations, using a lambda function can make the code more readable compared to defining a separate named function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Limitations of Lambda Functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.Single Expression: Lambda functions are limited to a single expression. They can't contain multiple statements or include control flow structures like if-else statements or loops. They are designed for simple and short operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Lack of Name: Lambda functions are anonymous, meaning they don't have a name associated with them. This can make debugging and error tracking more challenging since error messages will refer to the lambda function as \"<lambda>\".\n",
    "\n",
    "3.Limited Functionality: While lambda functions can handle simple operations efficiently, they are not suitable for complex or lengthy operations. Regular functions can include multiple lines of code, have named parameters, and provide better code organization and reusability.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.Reduced Readability: While lambda functions can improve readability in some cases, they can also make the code harder to understand if they are used extensively or for complex operations. Code readability can suffer if lambda functions are used excessively or if their purpose is not immediately clear.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, lambda functions offer a concise syntax and are useful for simple, one-time operations. However, they have limitations in terms of functionality, readability, and debugging, which may make regular functions a better choice for more complex tasks or when code organization and reusability are important."
