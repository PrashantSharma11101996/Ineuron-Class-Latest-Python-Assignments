    "Escape Sequences: The backslash is used to escape special characters within a string. When a backslash is placed before a character, it changes the character's meaning. For example:\n",

    "\\\" represents a double quote (\")\n",
    "\\\\ represents a literal backslash ()\n",
    "\\n represents a newline character\n",
    "\\t represents a tab character\n",
    "Raw Strings: The backslash can be used to create raw strings by prefixing a string literal with r. In a raw string, backslashes are treated as literal characters and not as escape characters. This is often useful when dealing with regular expressions, file paths, or strings that contain backslashes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: path = r'C:\\Users\\username\\Documents'\n",
    "Line Continuation: The backslash can be used to continue a single logical line of code across multiple physical lines. This is helpful for improving code readability when a line of code becomes too long.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: result = 10 + 20 + 30 + \\ 40 + 50\n",
    "Unicode Escapes: The backslash can be used to represent Unicode characters by using the \\uXXXX or \\UXXXXXXXX escape sequences, where XXXX represents a four-digit hexadecimal value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: print('\\u03A3') prints the Greek capital letter sigma (Σ)\n",

    "Immutable data types ensure data integrity, provide consistency, and allow for easier debugging, as you can rely on the values not being modified unexpectedly. Mutable data types, on the other hand, allow for efficient in-place modifications but require careful handling to ensure consistency and avoid unintended side effects.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's worth noting that although some data types in Python are mutable or immutable by default, you can sometimes achieve immutability by using specific methods or techniques. For example, you can create a tuple with mutable elements, resulting in a technically mutable object, but the tuple itself remains immutable."
